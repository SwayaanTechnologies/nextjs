### **What is Next.js?**

**Next.js** is a powerful React framework used to build **full-stack, production-ready web applications**. While React itself is a library focused solely on building user interfaces, it lacks the structure and features required for creating complete applications.

Next.js builds on top of React, providing a robust framework that includes:

* File-based routing
* Optimized rendering (server-side and client-side)
* Integrated API routes
* Bundling and compiling
* Performance optimizations

These features come built-in, so there’s no need to manually install or configure third-party libraries for most use cases. Next.js follows certain conventions and opinions, but they are based on real-world experience building production applications and make development more efficient and scalable.

---

### **Why Learn Next.js?**

Next.js greatly simplifies the process of building production-ready web applications. Some of the standout features include:

* [**File-Based Routing**](#file-based-routing)
* [**Built-In API Routes**](#built-in-api-routes)
* [**Rendering Flexibility**](#rendering-flexibility)
* [**Streamlined Data Fetching**](#streamlined-data-fetching)
* [**Performance Optimizations**](#performance-optimizations)
* [**Optimized Build System**](#optimized-build-system)

---

#### **File-Based Routing**

Instead of configuring a routing library manually (as in traditional React apps), you simply create files in the `app` or `pages` directory, and routes are generated automatically.

---

#### **Built-In API Routes**

Next.js allows you to build both frontend React components and backend APIs in the same codebase. This tight integration streamlines development and simplifies full-stack applications.

---

#### **Rendering Flexibility**

Next.js supports multiple rendering methods:

* Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
* Static Site Generation (SSG)
* Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

This flexibility allows for better performance and SEO (Search Engine Optimization).

---

#### **Streamlined Data Fetching**

With built-in support for asynchronous data fetching in React components, fetching data becomes more intuitive and efficient.

---

#### **Styling Options**

Next.js supports various styling methods:

* CSS Modules
* Tailwind CSS
* CSS-in-JS solutions

---

#### **Performance Optimizations**

Next.js includes automatic optimizations for:

* Images
* Fonts
* Scripts

These help improve **Core Web Vitals** and enhance the overall user experience.

---

#### **Optimized Build System**

Next.js offers a seamless development experience and an efficient production build pipeline—allowing you to focus on building features rather than dealing with configurations.

---

### **Prerequisites**

Before starting with Next.js, you should be familiar with:

* **HTML and CSS**
* **Modern JavaScript** (ES6+)
* **React fundamentals**, including:

  * Functional components
  * Props and state
  * JSX
  * React Hooks

---

## **Getting Started Hello World Application**

Let's begin by setting up a simple **Hello World** application using Next.js. This step will walk you through setting up your development environment and creating your first project.

* [**Prerequisites**](#prerequisites)
* [**Step 1: Create a Project Folder**](#step-1-create-a-project-folder)
* [**Step 2: Create a New Next.js App**](#step-2-create-a-new-next.js-app)
* [**Step 3: Run the Development Server**](#step-3-run-the-development-server)
* [**Step 4: Make Your First Edit**](#step-4-make-your-first-edit)

---

### **Prerequisites**

Before creating a Next.js app, ensure the following are installed on your system:

* **Node.js** (version **18.18.0** or later): Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
* **Code Editor**: Any editor will work, but **Visual Studio Code** is recommended ([Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

---

### **Step 1 Create a Project Folder**

Create a folder to store your project files:

```bash
mkdir nextjs-tutorial
cd nextjs-tutorial
```

Open the folder in your code editor. If you're using VS Code:

```bash
code .
```

---

### **Step 2 Create a New Next.js App**

Run the following command in your terminal to scaffold a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

You will be prompted to answer some configuration questions. Use the following choices:

| Prompt                               | Choice               |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Project name                         | `hello-world`        |
| TypeScript                           | Yes                  |
| ESLint                               | Yes                  |
| Tailwind CSS                         | Yes                  |
| Source directory                     | Yes (`/src`)         |
| App Router                           | Yes (recommended)    |
| Customize import alias               | No (default setting) |
| Use Turbopack (experimental bundler) | No                   |

Once completed, a new folder called `hello-world` will be created with your Next.js project setup.

---

### **Step 3 Run the Development Server**

Navigate into the project folder:

```bash
cd hello-world
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Open the link in your browser.

You should see the default Next.js welcome page with the message:

> Get started by editing `src/app/page.tsx`

---

### **Step 4 Make Your First Edit**

To test live editing, follow these steps:

1. In your editor, open:
   `src/app/page.tsx`

2. Locate the section that says:
   *"Get started by editing `src/app/page.tsx`"*

3. Replace the second list item text with:

```tsx
Hello World
```

4. Save the file. Your browser will automatically refresh, and you’ll see your changes reflected instantly.

Congratulations — your first Next.js application is up and running!

---

## **Project Structure**

After creating and running a basic Next.js application, it's important to understand the structure of the project. This section breaks down the key files and folders that power your app.

* [**Key Files**](#key-files)
* [**Key Folders**](#key-folders)
* [**How It All Works**](#how-it-all-works)

---

### **Key Files**

* [**`package.json`**](#package.json)
* [**Configuration Files**](#configuration-files)
* [**Other Files**](#other-files)

#### **`package.json`**

* Manages **project dependencies** and **scripts**.
* Common dependencies include:

  * `next` (v15)
  * `react` and `react-dom` (v19)
  * Optionally: `typescript`, `@types/*`, `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, `eslint`

* Common scripts:

  * `dev` – Start development server
  * `build` – Build for production
  * `start` – Start the production server
  * `lint` – Run ESLint using built-in configuration

#### **Configuration Files**

* `next.config.js` – Next.js configuration
* `tsconfig.json` – TypeScript settings
* `eslint.config.js` – ESLint configuration
* `tailwind.config.js` & `postcss.config.js` – Tailwind CSS setup

#### **Other Files**

* `package-lock.json` – Locks dependency versions for consistent installs
* `.gitignore` – Files and folders to ignore in version control
* `README.md` – Project overview and instructions
* `next-env.d.ts` – TypeScript environment declarations for Next.js

---

### **Key Folders**

* [**`.next/`**](#.next/)
* [**`node_modules/`**](#node_modules/)
* [**`public/`**](#public/)
* [**`src/`**](#src/)

#### **`.next/`**

* Generated automatically during development or build.
* Stores compiled output and other internal data.
* **Ignored by version control** – no need to interact with it.

#### **`node_modules/`**

* Contains all project dependencies.
* Created by `npm install` or during initial project setup.
* Also **ignored by version control**.

#### **`public/`**

* Stores **static assets** like images, SVGs, and favicon files.
* Files in this folder are served at the root path (`/`).

#### **`src/`**

This is where most of the application code lives.

**Inside `src/`:**

* **`app/`** – The entry point of the application using the **App Router** (available from Next.js 13+).

**Files inside `app/`:**

* `favicon.ico` – Browser tab icon.
* `global.css` – Global styles for the app.
* `layout.tsx` – Root layout file. Used to wrap pages with shared UI (like headers, footers, themes).
* `page.tsx` – The **home page** of your app (`/` route). This is what you initially see when visiting `http://localhost:3000`.

> The component in `page.tsx` is passed as a child to the layout defined in `layout.tsx`. This composition defines the full structure of your home page.

You might notice a font import in `layout.tsx` (such as a Google font). This may appear differently depending on the exact minor version of Next.js, but it doesn’t impact core learning.

---

### **How It All Works**

When you run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The development server starts and executes the following flow:

1. **`package.json`** provides the `dev` script.
2. The **root layout** (`layout.tsx`) is rendered.
3. For the root URL (`/`), Next.js looks for `page.tsx` inside the `app/` folder.
4. The component from `page.tsx` is rendered as a child inside `layout.tsx`.

This is how the base UI is constructed and served at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## **React Server Components**

Before diving into routing in Next.js, it's important to understand a core concept introduced in modern React and adopted by Next.js: **React Server Components (RSC)**.

* [**What Are React Server Components?**](#what-are-react-server-components?)
* [**Server vs Client Components**](#server-vs-client-components)
* [**When to Use Each**](#when-to-use-each)
* [**Why This Matters for Routing**](#why-this-matters-for-routing)

---

### **What Are React Server Components?**

React Server Components represent a new architecture developed by the React team that introduces a more powerful and efficient way to build applications by dividing components into two categories:

* **Server Components**
* **Client Components**

This model is fully supported in **Next.js 13+**, and is a default behavior in **Next.js 15+**.

---

### **Server vs Client Components**

* [**Server Components**](#server-components)
* [**Client Components**](#client-components)

#### **Server Components**

* Executed **on the server**.
* Can perform server-side operations such as:

  * Reading from the file system
  * Fetching data directly from databases

* **Cannot** use React hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`) or handle browser events (e.g., `onClick`).
* Ideal for performance, SEO, and resource-heavy tasks that don’t require user interaction.

#### **Client Components**

* Executed **in the browser**.
* Enable full interactivity:

  * Can use **React hooks**
  * Can handle **user interactions**
* Must begin with a special directive at the top of the file:

  ```tsx
  'use client';
  ```
* These behave just like traditional React components.

---

### **When to Use Each**

* Use **Server Components** by default whenever possible for performance and simplicity.
* Use **Client Components** when you need:

  * Hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRouter`, etc.
  * DOM events and interactions (clicks, forms, etc.)
  * Dynamic rendering on the client side

---

### **Why This Matters for Routing**

Understanding the distinction between server and client components is critical before learning how **routing** works in Next.js. Many routing features (like transitions, navigation hooks, or loading indicators) rely on using client components effectively.

---

## **Routing**

Routing is one of the core features of **Next.js**, and it follows a **file-based routing** system. This means your app’s URL structure is directly mapped from how you organize folders and files within the `app` directory.

* [**Key Routing Conventions in Next.js**](#key-routing-conventions-in-next.js)
* [**Scenario 1 Create a Homepage**](#scenario-1-create-a-homepage)
* [**Scenario 2 Create `About` and `Profile` Routes**](#scenario-2-create-about-and-profile-routes)
* [**Summary of Key Routing Concepts**](#summary-of-key-routing-concepts)

---

### **Key Routing Conventions in Next.js**

Next.js routing is based on a few important conventions:

1. **All routes must live inside the `app/` folder** (which itself lives inside `src/`).
2. **Each route must be defined in a file named `page.tsx`** (or `page.js` if not using TypeScript).
3. **Each folder represents a segment of the URL path.**

---

### **Scenario 1 Create a Homepage**

We want a simple homepage available at: `http://localhost:3000/`.

**Steps:**

1. Inside the `src/` directory, create a new folder called `app/`.
2. Inside the `app/` folder, create a file named `page.tsx`.
3. Add the following code:

```tsx
export default function Home() {
  return <h1>Welcome Home</h1>;
}
```

4. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser—you'll see "Welcome Home" rendered.

> **Note**: Even though we deleted the original `layout.tsx`, Next.js will regenerate it behind the scenes as part of its default behavior. We'll cover layouts in detail later.

---

### **Scenario 2 Create `About` and `Profile` Routes**

We’ll now create two new routes:

* `/about` → shows an About page
* `/profile` → shows a Profile page

**Steps:**

1. In the `app/` folder, create a new folder named `about/`.
2. Inside `about/`, create a file named `page.tsx` with:

```tsx
export default function About() {
  return <h1>About Me</h1>;
}
```

3. Similarly, create another folder inside `app/` called `profile/`.
4. Inside `profile/`, create `page.tsx` with:

```tsx
export default function Profile() {
  return <h1>My Profile</h1>;
}
```

5. Save the files and navigate to the URLs:

   * `http://localhost:3000/about` → displays "About Me"
   * `http://localhost:3000/profile` → displays "My Profile"

---

### **Summary of Key Routing Concepts**

* `page.tsx` inside the `app/` folder maps to the root route `/`.

* Each folder in `app/` represents a **URL segment**.

* A `page.tsx` file inside a folder maps to that folder's **route path**.

  For example:

  ```
  src/
  └── app/
      ├── page.tsx              --> /
      ├── about/
      │   └── page.tsx          --> /about
      └── profile/
          └── page.tsx          --> /profile
  ```

* If a user navigates to a route that doesn’t exist (e.g., `/dashboard`), Next.js automatically returns a **404 Not Found** page.

---

## **Nested Routes**

Routing uses a **file-based routing system**, where folders and files under the `app/` directory determine the structure of your application’s URLs. Now, let’s explore **nested routing** by implementing a `blog` section with its own sub-routes.

* [**Scenario 3 Create a Blog Route with Nested Pages**](#scenario-3-create-a-blog-route-with-nested-pages)
* [**Creating Nested Routes**](#creating-nested-routes)
* [**Route Structure Summary**](#route-structure-summary)

---

### **Scenario 3 Create a Blog Route with Nested Pages**

We want to implement the following routes:

* `/blog` – Main blog landing page
* `/blog/first` – First blog post
* `/blog/second` – Second blog post

**Steps:**

1. Inside the `app/` directory, create a folder named `blog/`.
2. Inside `blog/`, create a `page.tsx` file:

```tsx
export default function Blog() {
  return <h1>My Blog</h1>;
}
```

3. This will render at `http://localhost:3000/blog`.

---

### **Creating Nested Routes**

To handle `/blog/first` and `/blog/second`, follow these steps:

1. Inside the `blog/` folder, create two subfolders: `first/` and `second/`.
2. In each of those folders, create a `page.tsx` file:

**`app/blog/first/page.tsx`**

```tsx
export default function FirstBlogPost() {
  return <h1>First Blog Post</h1>;
}
```

`app/blog/second/page.tsx`

```tsx
export default function SecondBlogPost() {
  return <h1>Second Blog Post</h1>;
}
```

3. Now the following routes are available:

   * `http://localhost:3000/blog/first` → shows *First Blog Post*
   * `http://localhost:3000/blog/second` → shows *Second Blog Post*

---

### **Route Structure Summary**

Your folder and file structure now looks like this:

```
src/
└── app/
    └── blog/
        ├── page.tsx           → /blog
        ├── first/
        │   └── page.tsx       → /blog/first
        └── second/
            └── page.tsx       → /blog/second
```

**Key Takeaway**

Next.js automatically mirrors your folder structure into URL routes. You don’t need to write route configuration files or install any extra libraries—**just follow the folder and file naming conventions**, and routing will work out of the box.

Next, we’ll explore something even more powerful: **Dynamic Routes**.

Here is the **Dynamic Routes** section of your tutorial, rewritten clearly and professionally for your README:

---

## **Dynamic Routes**

Previous example, we've seen how **nested routing** works by creating folders like `/blog/first` and `/blog/second`. However, this approach doesn't scale well for large datasets or content fetched dynamically. That’s where **dynamic routes** come in.

* [**Scenario 4 Product Listing and Dynamic Detail Pages**](#scenario-4-product-listing-and-dynamic-detail-pages)
* [**Step 1 Create the Static Product List**](#step-1-create-the-static-product-list)
* [**Step 2 Set Up the Dynamic Route**](#step-2-set-up-the-dynamic-route)
* [**Dynamic Segments**](#dynamic-segments)
* [**Dynamic Routing Structure Summary**](#dynamic-routing-structure-summary)

---

### **Scenario 4 Product Listing and Dynamic Detail Pages**

We want to implement two types of routes:

* `/products` – A static list of products
* `/products/[productId]` – A dynamic route that displays product details based on the ID

---

### **Step 1 Create the Static Product List**

1. Inside the `app/` directory, create a `products/` folder.
2. Inside `products/`, create a `page.tsx` file:

```tsx
export default function ProductList() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Product List</h1>
      <h2>Product 1</h2>
      <h2>Product 2</h2>
      <h2>Product 3</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
```

* This page will render at `http://localhost:3000/products`.

---

### **Step 2 Set Up the Dynamic Route**

Manually creating a folder for every product ID (like `/products/1`, `/products/2`, etc.) isn’t scalable. Instead, we use **dynamic segments**.

1. Inside the `products/` folder, create a new folder named `[productId]/`.
2. Inside `[productId]/`, create a `page.tsx` file:

```tsx
// app/products/[productId]/page.tsx

type Params = {
  params: {
    productId: string;
  };
};

export default async function ProductDetails({ params }: Params) {
  const { productId } = params;

  return <h1>Details about Product {productId}</h1>;
}
```

* This file handles all routes like:

  * `/products/1`
  * `/products/2`
  * `/products/iPhone`
  * `/products/abc123`

---

### **Dynamic Segments**

* A folder name in square brackets like `[productId]` tells Next.js to treat it as a **dynamic route parameter**.
* The `params` object contains all route parameters and is **available to server components** as a prop.

---

### **Dynamic Routing Structure Summary**

Here’s what your folder structure looks like now:

```
src/
└── app/
    └── products/
        ├── page.tsx              → /products
        └── [productId]/
            └── page.tsx          → /products/:productId
```

Now any route that matches `/products/*` is handled dynamically.

---

**Example Output**

* Visiting `/products/1` shows: **Details about Product 1**
* Visiting `/products/abc` shows: **Details about Product abc**

---

## **Nested Dynamic Routes**

In many real-world applications, you'll often need to handle **multiple dynamic segments** in a single URL. That’s where **nested dynamic routing** becomes incredibly useful.

* [**Scenario 5 Product Reviews**](#scenario-5-product-reviews)
* [**Step-by-Step Setup**](#step-by-step-setup)
* [**Nested Dynamic Routing Structure Summary**](#nested-dynamic-routing-structure-summary)

---

### **Scenario 5 Product Reviews**

We’ve already implemented dynamic product detail pages at:

```
/products/[productId]
```

Now, we want to extend this further to support product reviews like:

```
/products/[productId]/reviews/[reviewId]
```

This means:

* `/products/1` shows **Product 1 details**
* `/products/1/reviews/1` shows **Review 1 for Product 1**

---

### **Step-by-Step Setup**

* [**Step 1 Start from Existing Dynamic Route**](#step-1-start-from-existing-dynamic-route)
* [**Step 2 Add `reviews/` Folder**](#step-2-add-reviews/-folder)
* [**Step 3 Add Dynamic `[reviewId]/` Folder**](#step-3-add-dynamic-[reviewid]/-folder)

#### **Step 1 Start from Existing Dynamic Route**

We already have this structure:

```
app/
└── products/
    └── [productId]/
        └── page.tsx   → /products/:productId
```

#### **Step 2 Add `reviews/` Folder**

Inside `app/products/[productId]/`, create a folder named `reviews`. This will map to:

```
/products/:productId/reviews
```

#### **Step 3 Add Dynamic `[reviewId]/` Folder**

Inside the `reviews/` folder, create a new folder named `[reviewId]`.

Inside `[reviewId]/`, add a `page.tsx` file:

```tsx
// app/products/[productId]/reviews/[reviewId]/page.tsx

type Params = {
  params: {
    productId: string;
    reviewId: string;
  };
};

export default async function ProductReview({ params }: Params) {
  const { productId, reviewId } = params;

  return <h1>Review {reviewId} for Product {productId}</h1>;
}
```

Now, when you visit:

* `/products/1/reviews/1` → You’ll see **Review 1 for Product 1**

* `/products/100/reviews/5` → You’ll see **Review 5 for Product 100**

---

### **Nested Dynamic Routing Structure Summary**

```
src/
└── app/
    └── products/
        └── [productId]/
            ├── page.tsx              → /products/:productId
            └── reviews/
                └── [reviewId]/
                    └── page.tsx      → /products/:productId/reviews/:reviewId
```

---

**Key Takeaway**

You can create nested dynamic routes easily using folders with square brackets:

* `[productId]` is the first dynamic segment
* `[reviewId]` is a nested dynamic segment

Each segment corresponds to a part of the URL and is made available through the `params` object in your component.

---

## **Catch-all Segments**

Catch-all segments in Next.js allow you to handle dynamic routes with multiple path segments using just a **single file**. This is especially powerful for documentation sites, wikis, and other apps that require deeply nested or flexible routing structures.

* [**Scenario 6 Documentation Site with Nested Routes**](#scenario-6-documentation-site-with-nested-routes)
* [**Use a Catch-all Route**](#use-a-catch-all-route)
* [**Optional Catch-all Segments**](#optional-catch-all-segments)
* [**Catch-all Segments Structure Summary**](#catch-all-segments-structure-summary)

---

### **Scenario 6 Documentation Site with Nested Routes**

Imagine building a documentation site where each feature contains several concepts, and each concept might have further nested examples. Example routes:

```
/docs/feature1/concept1  
/docs/feature1/concept2  
/docs/feature2/concept1/example1  
...
```

Now, if you had 20 features and each had 20 concepts, you'd be looking at **400+ different routes**. File-based routing would make this hard to scale—unless we use **dynamic** and **catch-all segments**.

---

### **Use a Catch-all Route**

We can simplify this setup to just **one** route handler using a catch-all segment.

* [**Step 1 Create the Catch-all Folder**](#step-1-create-the-catch-all-folder)
* [**Step 2 Implement the Component**](#step-2-implement-the-component)

#### **Step 1 Create the Catch-all Folder**

In your `app` directory, create the following structure:

```
app/
└── docs/
    └── [...slug]/
        └── page.tsx
```

* The folder `[...slug]` uses the `...` syntax (like the JavaScript spread operator), which means: “match **any number of path segments**.”
* Inside `[...slug]`, create a `page.tsx` file.

---

#### **Step 2 Implement the Component**

Here’s a simple example of how to access and display the segments:

```tsx
// app/docs/[...slug]/page.tsx

type Params = {
  params: {
    slug?: string[];
  };
};

export default async function DocsPage({ params }: Params) {
  const slug = params.slug ?? [];

  if (slug.length === 2) {
    return <h1>Viewing docs for feature "{slug[0]}" and concept "{slug[1]}"</h1>;
  }

  if (slug.length === 1) {
    return <h1>Viewing docs for feature "{slug[0]}"</h1>;
  }

  return <h1>Docs homepage</h1>;
}
```

Now try visiting these routes:

* `/docs/routing` → Viewing docs for feature **routing**

* `/docs/routing/catch-all-segments` → Viewing docs for feature **routing** and concept **catch-all-segments**

* `/docs` → You’ll see a **404** error (but we’ll fix that next!)

---

### **Optional Catch-all Segments**

To handle even `/docs` using the same file, make the segment **optional** by renaming the folder to:

```
[[...slug]]
```

So now the structure becomes:

```
app/
└── docs/
    └── [[...slug]]/
        └── page.tsx
```

Now, `/docs` will also be matched and render the same page component.

**Use Cases**

Use **optional catch-all segments** when:

* You want a single page to handle multiple levels of routes.
* The layout or logic of the page depends on the depth or content of the route.

### **Catch-all Segments Structure Summary**

```
app/
├── page.tsx                  → /
└── docs/
    └── [[...slug]]/
        └── page.tsx          → /docs/* (all depths)
```

* **Catch-all segments** (`[...slug]`) match any number of nested route segments.
* **Optional catch-all segments** (`[[...slug]]`) also match when no segments are present.
* Use `params.slug` to access the segments in your component.
* Ideal for documentation sites, blogs, and pages with variable depth.
